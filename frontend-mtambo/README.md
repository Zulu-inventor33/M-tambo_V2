## Introduction

**M-Tambo** is a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) designed specifically for tracking and managing elevator maintenance. The system is built to cater to three primary user roles:
- **Developers**: Building owners who need to monitor the status of their elevators.
- **Maintenance Managers**: Professionals responsible for delegating maintenance tasks to technicians.
- **Technicians**: Individuals who perform the actual maintenance work.

The system is built using a modern tech stack, with **React** for the frontend and **Django REST Framework** for the backend. This ensures a seamless, responsive, and scalable experience for all users.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Maintenance Tracking**: Monitor the status of elevator maintenance in real-time.
- **Task Delegation**: Maintenance managers can assign tasks to technicians efficiently.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure access based on user roles (Developer, Maintenance Manager, Technician).
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports on maintenance history, downtime, and technician performance.
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts for upcoming maintenance schedules and task assignments.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with React for seamless interaction across devices.
